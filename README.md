Swiggy-Style Food Ordering Application

A Swiggy-inspired food ordering web application built as part of the Namaste React course, focusing on modern React concepts, performance optimization, and clean UI architecture.

✨ Key Features

Dynamic Restaurant & Product Listing

Integrated a demo REST API to fetch and display restaurants and food items

Rendered product details such as name, image, cuisine, ratings, and delivery time

Search & Filter Functionality

Implemented real-time search to filter restaurants by name

Added a Top Rated Restaurants filter based on ratings

Multi-Page Navigation

Created multiple pages (Home, Restaurant Menu, Cart, Login) using React Router

Authentication UI

Designed Login and Logout user interfaces (UI-level authentication flow)

Performance Optimization

Implemented Lazy Loading and React Suspense for route-based code splitting

Improved initial load time by loading components only when required

Reusable & Scalable Architecture

Used Higher-Order Components (HOCs) to enhance restaurant cards and highlight promoted restaurants

Followed component-based architecture for better reusability and maintainability

Modern UI Development

Clean, responsive layout inspired by Swiggy’s design system

Optimized UI rendering with conditional rendering and shimmer (loading) effects
